[18/09/24, 1:32:10 PM] ~ Arnav ✨: Subject: Request for Rescheduling CAO or Data Science Exam Due to Overlap

Dear Sir,
I hope this message finds you well. We would like to bring to your attention a scheduling issue that is causing concern among COE students. We have three major exams within a span of 30 hours:

25 September (8:00 AM): Computer Architecture & Organization (UCS510)
25 September (3:00 PM): Data Science (UCS503/UCS531/UCS551)
26 September (8:00 AM): Software Engineering (UCS503)
Given the intensive preparation required for both CAO and Data Science, having two major exams on the same day, followed by another the next morning, is overwhelming. We kindly request that either the CAO or Data Science exam be rescheduled.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]
